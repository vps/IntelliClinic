### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies

- The platform's performance is contingent upon the reliability of AWS cloud hosting services.
- AI model effectiveness depends on the quality and breadth of the training data set provided by healthcare partners.

## 3. System Features

### 3.1 AI-Driven Dynamic Intake

The AI-driven dynamic intake feature will utilize an intelligent questionnaire that adapts to patient responses in real-time, enhancing the quality of data collected during the patient intake process. The system will use a decision tree algorithm, trained on extensive healthcare datasets, to guide the questioning dynamically, ensuring that the most relevant information is gathered efficiently.

### 3.2 Focused HPI Generation

Using advanced natural language processing techniques, the system will generate focused HPIs. The AI model will be trained on a large corpus of anonymized patient histories, learning to identify and extract clinically relevant information, thereby streamlining the documentation process for healthcare providers.

### 3.3 NLP for Note Management

The platform will feature an NLP module designed to convert unstructured patient notes into structured, actionable data. This module will support the generation of comprehensive patient reports, facilitate easy information retrieval, and provide decision support through the extraction of key medical entities from free-text notes.

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interfaces

A responsive web-based user interface will be developed to provide users with a seamless experience across various devices. The interface will be designed with a focus on usability, ensuring that users can navigate the platform intuitively.
