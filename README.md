## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document specifies the technical requirements and architectural design for the development of an AI-Powered Healthcare Platform, hereinafter referred to as "AHP". AHP is designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare services through the application of artificial intelligence.

### 1.2 Scope

The AHP will be a comprehensive solution capable of optimizing patient intake, generating focused HPI, aiding in differential assessment and planning, and automating patient note creation.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

- **HPI**: History of Present Illness
- **MVP**: Minimum Viable Product
- **EHR**: Electronic Health Record
- **NLP**: Natural Language Processing
- **API**: Application Programming Interface
- **SSL**: Secure Sockets Layer

### 1.4 References

- HIPAA Compliance Documentation
- FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) Specification
- Python Documentation

### 1.5 Overview

The document details the product functions, user interfaces, system features, and security requirements.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective

AHP will function as a standalone module capable of seamless integration with existing healthcare IT ecosystems, enhancing their capabilities through AI-driven solutions.

### 2.2 Product Functions

- AI-driven patient intake
- Generation of focused HPI
- Differential diagnosis support
- Automated patient note creation
- Integration with EHR systems

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics

- **Physicians**: Require efficiency in documentation and patient management.
- **Patients**: Seek medical advice and use AHP for preliminary assessments.
- **Administrators**: Manage AHP operation and oversee system settings.

### 2.4 Operating Environment

AHP will be a cloud-based SaaS solution, accessible via web browsers on desktop and mobile devices.

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints

- AHP will be developed using the Django web framework.
- Compliance with HIPAA is mandatory.
- The initial release will

 support English language only.

### 2.6 User Documentation

- Online help within the application.
- User manual for end-users and administrators.
- API documentation for integrators.

### 2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies

- Access to cloud services provided by AWS.
- The initial AI model will be trained on a dataset provided by a partnering healthcare institution.

## 3. System Features

### 3.1 AI-Driven Dynamic Intake

The system will include an AI-driven dynamic intake process that adapts questions based on initial patient responses.

### 3.2 Focused HPI Generation

The system will generate a focused HPI using an AI model that structures and prioritizes patient history details.

### 3.3 NLP for Note Management

NLP algorithms will be used to automate the creation and management of patient notes.

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interfaces

- The system will have a responsive web interface.
- Dashboards for real-time data presentation.

### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces

No specific hardware interface is required.

### 4.3 Software Interfaces

- AWS for cloud hosting.
- FHIR API for EHR integration.
- Python libraries for NLP.

### 4.4 Communications Interfaces

- HTTPS for secure data transmission.

## 5. System Features

### 5.1 Security Requirements

- Response times will not exceed 2 seconds for any transaction.

### 6.2 Safety Requirements

- Error handling mechanisms to prevent system crashes.
- Data validation to prevent incorrect data entry.

### 6.3 Security Requirements

- All data will be encrypted at rest using AES-256.
- Regular security audits and compliance checks.

### 6.4 Software Quality Attributes

- Scalability: Designed to easily add more resources.
- Flexibility: Modular design for easy updates and changes.

### 6.5 Business Rules

- The system will prioritize data privacy in accordance with HIPAA.

## 7. Other Requirements

- Data backups will be performed daily.
- A disaster recovery plan will be established and tested quarterly.

## 8. Appendix A: Glossary

Refer to [1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations](#13-definitions-acronyms-and-abbreviations).

## 9. Appendix B: Analysis Models

Included are ER diagrams, UML models, and data flow diagrams for the AHP.
