- The initial AI model will be trained on a dataset provided by a partnering healthcare institution.

## 3. System Features

### 3.1 AI-Driven Dynamic Intake

This feature will include an intelligent questionnaire that adapts to the patient's inputs in real-time. The AI will analyze responses to prioritize follow-up questions, minimize patient fatigue, and maximize the collection of relevant health data. The system will utilize a decision tree algorithm which will be trained on initial datasets to recognize patterns in symptom presentation and medical history.

### 3.2 Focused HPI Generation

The AI model will process the intake information to produce a concise HPI document. The model will be trained using supervised learning techniques on anonymized patient histories to identify and summarize key health information, which will be crucial for the differential diagnosis phase.

### 3.3 NLP for Note Management

The NLP module will convert free-text patient notes into structured data. It will employ text analysis to extract and categorize medical entities, such as symptoms, diagnoses, and treatments, facilitating easy search and retrieval. This module will be essential for generating summaries and reports for both healthcare providers and patients.

## 4. External Interface Requirements

### 4.1 User Interfaces

- The system will have a responsive web interface.
- Dashboards for real-time data presentation.

The web interface will be built using a mobile-first design approach ensuring compatibility with a wide range of devices. The user interface will be clean and minimalistic, with an emphasis on usability and accessibility standards. It will include interactive elements such as modals, tooltips, and dropdown menus to provide a dynamic user experience without overwhelming the user with medical jargon.

### 4.2 Hardware Interfaces

No specific hardware interface is required.

### 4.3 Software Interfaces

- AWS for cloud hosting.
- FHIR API for EHR integration.
- Python libraries for NLP.

### 4.4 Communications Interfaces

- HTTPS for secure data transmission.

The platform will use RESTful APIs for communication between the frontend and backend services. These APIs will be secured using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure that only authenticated and authorized users can access sensitive endpoints.


## 5. System Features

### 5.1 Security Requirements

- OAuth 2.0 for authentication.
- SSL encryption for data in transit.

### 5.2 Software Quality Attributes

- Reliability: Cloud-hosting for high availability.
- Usability: Intuitive interface design.
- Maintainability: Well-documented codebase with unit tests.

## 6. Other Nonfunctional Requirements

### 6.1 Performance Requirements

- The system will support a minimum of 1,000 concurrent users.
- Response times will not exceed 2 seconds for any transaction.

The platform will be optimized for quick load times, with an aim for initial contentful paint to occur within 1 second, and interactive readiness within 2 seconds over a standard broadband connection. To achieve this, backend services will be stateless to enable horizontal scaling, and front-end assets will be minimized and served from a content delivery network (CDN).

### 6.2 Safety Requirements

- Error handling mechanisms to prevent system crashes.
- Data validation to prevent incorrect data entry.

The platform will feature robust input validation to prevent common security threats such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). It will also implement rate limiting to protect against denial-of-service attacks.

### 6.3 Security Requirements

- All data will be encrypted at rest using AES-256.
- Regular security audits and compliance checks.

### 6.4 Software Quality Attributes

- Scalability: Designed to easily add more resources.
- Flexibility: Modular design for easy updates and changes.

### 6.5 Business Rules

- The system will prioritize data privacy in accordance with HIPAA.

## 7. Other Requirements

- Data backups will be performed daily.
- A disaster recovery plan will be established and tested quarterly.

### Data Retention and Archiving

Data retention policies will comply with medical data retention requirements, which typically dictate that patient records be preserved for a minimum number of years post-treatment. Archiving solutions will be implemented to ensure data is securely stored long-term and can be retrieved when necessary.

### Legal and Regulatory Compliance

The platform will comply with all relevant healthcare regulations, including but not limited to HIPAA in the United States, GDPR in the European Union, and PIPEDA in Canada. Regular audits will be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance.
